			EeeNote EA-800 kernel patches

Mainline kernel version: 3.4.2

This is an effort to bring EA-800 support in one of the latest mainline kernel
branches.
Supported features summary:
1) LCD
	Module: PXA framebuffer + machine description
	Status: full support, dual buffering NOT supported at the moment
	Mode: 768x1024, 16 bit color (though, LCD is 64-level grayscale)
2) microSD
	Module: pxamci-multi MMC host driver
	Status: full support for both slots
	Issues: driver is relatively fresh, and theoretically unstable,
		however, no bugs noticed yet.
3) WiFi
	Module: pxamci MMC host driver + libertas-sdio WiFi chip driver
	Status: full support
	Issues: pxamci doesn't use multi-descriptor DMA,
		leading to noticeable CPU load during intensive transfers.
4) Wacom touchscreen
	Module: w8001 driver for Wacom ISDV4 protocol digitizers
	Status: full support
	Issues: though kernel fully supports touchscreen,
		it requires heavy userspace support too (inputattach,
		calibration, pressure support by user apps and so on).
5) Touch keyboard
	Module: lds61xx driver for IDT LDS6100 family
	Status: no LED support yet, not exposed via Event subsystem,
		but prints nice messages in console when touched,
		"Work In Progress"
6) Sound
	Module: pxa2xx-ac97 AC97 driver + RT5611 codec ASoC driver
	Status: full support, complete userspace control over codec,
		no automatic switching when jack is plugged/unplugged
		(can be done by userspace)
7) Camera
	Module: none
	Status: no support yet, datasheets are subject to NDA
8) Battery
	Module: bq27x00 I2C battery monitor driver
	Status: full support, exports many interesting values via sysfs :)
9) Power management
	Status: full support for suspend/resume/poweroff/restart
		PM is not a primary issue at the moment

If I've forgotten to mention something, ask please.
